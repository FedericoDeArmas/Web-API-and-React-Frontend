# Web API and React Frontend

This project implements a web application with a Web API backend developed using ASP.NET Core and a frontend built with React. The purpose of this application is to manage employee data through CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Features

- **RESTful API:** The backend provides RESTful services to handle employee data, including endpoints for adding, editing, and deleting employees.
- **React Frontend:** The frontend is implemented using React, allowing users to interact with the employee data through a user-friendly interface.
- **Async/Await:** Asynchronous operations are handled using the async/await pattern to ensure responsive and efficient application behavior.
- **Entity Framework Core:** Entity Framework Core is used for data access in the backend, providing a convenient way to interact with the database.
- **Swagger Documentation:** Swagger is integrated to automatically generate API documentation, making it easier to understand and interact with the backend services.
- **Git Version Control:** Git is used for version control, enabling collaborative development and tracking of changes throughout the project.
